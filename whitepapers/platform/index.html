The rise in popularity of applications with features like end-to-end encryption is but one example. But such solutions are difficult to build, expensive to operate and often insufficient in the degree that they actually deliver privacy.</p><p>The current status quo, in which businesses collect and consolidate consumer data, results in large databases that are tempting targets for hackers. Because of this, new privacy laws such as the <a href=https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/>GDPR</a>, <a href=https://www.acc.com/resource-library/quick-overview-understanding-california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa>CCPA</a>, and 17 US <a href=https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/>state legislations</a> are being implemented. Compliance with these laws is a challenge developers face today that is often treated as an afterthought,and we believe that a better approach is to use a platform that delivers “privacy by design” and assures compliance from the outset.</p><p>Thus we have created a new architecture that addresses these issues at a fundamental level, starting with a new network protocol and a modern development platform implementation that makes it easy for developers to deliver “privacy first” applications.</p><p>If you are thinking about how to deliver applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking, read on. The @platform is designed to make it easy to do just that.</p><h2 id=a-simple-definition-of-the-platform>A Simple Definition of the @platform</h2><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 1.png" alt="@platform definition" width=65%></td><p><br>Figure 1. A Simple Definition of the @platform</p><p>The @ Company has created an open platform for developers who want to create applications that give people full control of their digital selves. The platform is based on the @protocol - a network protocol for the secure exchange of information only between known entities. It uses a unique identifier called an @sign that, combined with the @platform (which is based on the @protocol), allows people the freedom to share, withhold, or retract their information at will with minimal effort, and the developer no longer has to bear the cost and risk of storing and managing people’s personal data.</p><h1 id=technology-overview>Technology Overview</h1><p>This document describes a software platform with the necessary technology and tools to help developers create beautiful privacy-first mobile applications that are end-to-end encrypted, surveillance-free, and resistant to malicious hacking.</p><p>It is called the @platform, and is an open source project intended to make it easy for developers to develop and deploy just such applications including the requisite supporting infrastructure at no cost.</p><p>The @platform open source project is embodied in a <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation>public repository</a> which includes a full stack reference implementation, SDKs for application developers, useful documentation, tools, samples, and examples.</p><p>The reference implementation is licensed under the <a href=https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause/>BSD 3-Clause “New” or “Revised” License</a>. At the time of writing, a version written in the <a href=https://dart.dev/>Dart</a> language that supports the Flutter cross-platform framework has been released, with other languages and framework support expected in the future.</p><p>The technology is distributed via the <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>Pub package manager</a> as <a href=https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages>libraries</a> for application developers, and via <a href=https://hub.docker.com/u/atsigncompany>dockerhub</a> as containers for developers' infrastructure components.</p><h1 id=from-the-perspective-of-an-application-developer>From the Perspective of an Application Developer</h1><h2 id=the-beautiful-thing-about-a-protocol>The Beautiful Thing About a Protocol</h2><p>There are many important and unique things that arise as a result of an architecture based on a protocol. There is ample precedence for this statement based on other successful examples (SMTP and TCP/IP come to mind). The most important things for an application developer to know about how to use the @platform are:</p><ul><li>Data and processing are pushed to the edge of the internet.</li><li>Applications are based on a peer-to-peer shared data model.</li><li>The sharing of access to private data between application instances is end-to-end encrypted only between provable known parties to prevent surveillance, leakage, or other hijacking attacks.</li></ul><p>These things are the result of the use of the @protocol and can seem very different from the traditional client-server or API means of sharing access to data. Thus, the mental model for such a system, especially from an application developer&rsquo;s perspective, is worthy of discussion up front.</p><h4 id=heading></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 2.png" alt="Data shared on a device" width=70%></td><br>Figure 2: Example of How to Store Shared Data on a Device<p>As shown above, an application developer need only use the platform SDKS to store the application data locally on the device and include an @sign to share it with; the @platform will ensure that the data gets routed to the intended destination in a safe and secure manner. This peer-to-peer model is in contrast to centralized data stores that are fraught with risk of intentional or accidental breach or exposure of private data.</p><h2 id=a-different-way-of-thinking-about-data>A Different Way of Thinking About Data</h2><p>Certainly, there are many benefits to a decentralized data model with strict control on the part of the owner, and the @platform ensures that sharing access to private data is end-to-end encrypted, surveillance free and resistant to malicious hacking. But, there are other benefits of this architecture that may not be so obvious.</p><h3 id=people-own-their-data>People Own Their Data</h3><p>While this is obvious for a “privacy by design” platform, there are additional features that arise from adherence to this principle.</p><ul><li>Data can be portable between similar applications (i.e. swap one Calendar app for another without losing your data), which gives people more choices.</li><li>Application’s data can be shared between disparate applications (e.g. Contacts. Events, Messages) to create altogether new user experiences.</li><li>Applications can reason over “all” their data to produce compelling new services, perhaps aided by ML algorithms (with inferences executed on the mobile device in order to preserve privacy).</li></ul><h3 id=end-to-end-encryption>End-to-End Encryption</h3><p>The @platform ensures that the owner of their data has complete control over it. This is a result of three basic things (though there are many more additional options available that are explained below):</p><ol><li>Encryption happens at the edge.</li><li>The encryption keys are only available at the edge.</li><li>Data sharing is uniquely encrypted between the owner and the intended recipient.</li></ol><h3 id=data-on-the-edge>Data on The Edge</h3><p>A person’s private data is only available “in the clear” on either the owner’s device since only they have the keys to decrypt it or from cached data that can only be decrypted on the device of the recipient it was shared with. This removes the centralized target for hackers and makes any attempt at a large-scale data breach impractical.</p><h3 id=p2p-peer-to-peer-person-to-person>P2P (peer-to-peer, person-to-person)</h3><p>Also important to note is the fact that centralized, shared-tenant resources are no longer required for the sharing of access to private data. This not only saves cost, it also increases performance and security from things like denial of service attacks.</p><h3 id=a-kind-of-polymorphism>A Kind of Polymorphism</h3><p>This means of end-to-end encryption of data has a very interesting side effect in that it produces a kind of polymorphism. Since the shared data is end-to-end encrypted uniquely peer-to-peer between two parties, the answer to a query depends on who is asking, and a different response may be returned for different parties for the same query. For example:</p><table><tr><td><strong>Query</strong></td><td><strong>Who’s asking</strong></td><td><strong>Response</strong></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=3>location@alice</td><td>anonymous&lt;public></td><td>California</td></tr><tr><td>@bob</td><td>Bay Area</td></tr><tr><td>@carol</td><td>Home &lt;address></td></tr></table><p>This has already been used to create some very interesting new UX (User Experience) designs and offers many other potential use cases.</p><h4 id=heading-1></h4><td align=center><img src="/docs/Resources/Whitepapers/images/Fig 3.png" alt="Conceptual Model" width=70%></td><br>Figure 3: Data Model Includes Owner Data and Cached Data from Others<br><p>Enforcing data ownership is another important concept as illustrated in Figure 3. In this system, application data becomes a combination of data created by one @sign combined with data that has been shared by others. Since the shared data is encrypted uniquely for the intended recipient, it can only be accessed by them. In addition, the owner maintains control of it (i.e. updates and deletes), though it may be cached for offline use.

This requires such things as E2E encryption, key management, and passwordless, zero trust authentication. The SDKs are designed to take care of this complexity for the developer with the goal of making such security ubiquitous.</p><h1 id=the-atclientsdk-at_client_sdkhttpsgithubcomatsign-foundationat_client_sdk>The AtClientSDK (<a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk>at_client_sdk</a>)</h1><p>The AtClientSDK encapsulates the @protocol verbs and provides an application level abstraction that is familiar to developers.</p><h2 id=setup-and-configuration-methods>Setup and Configuration Methods</h2><p>The AtClientSDK requires initialization and setup. For convenience, there is a preference object with default settings that is used to configure the instance.</p><h3 id=_ltsetpreferences_><em>&lt;setPreferences></em></h3><p><em>void setPreferences(AtClientPreference preference)</em></p><p>The <em>setPreferences</em> method sets the preferences such as sync strategy, storage path etc., for the AtClient instance.</p><h3 id=lt_createclient_>&lt;<em>createClient</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;void> createClient(String currentAtSign, String? Namespace, AtClientPreference preference)</em></p><p>The <em>createClient</em> method is used to initialize the AtClient instance. This method accepts an @sign, non null application namespace and an AtClientPreference.</p><h3 id=_ltgetclient_><em>&lt;getClient></em></h3><p><em>Future&lt;AtClient?> getClient(String? currentAtSign)</em></p><p>Returns a new AtClient instance. This method requires a non null @sign.</p><h2 id=sync-verb-methods>Sync Verb Methods</h2><p>The AtClientPreference model includes a parameter for how the application will handle synchronization of data to the secondary server. These can be set to one of three enumerated values.</p><h3 id=_ltsyncstrategyimmediate_><em>&lt;SyncStrategy.IMMEDIATE></em></h3><p>SyncStrategy.IMMEDIATE will synchronize changes to local keys immediately as they change to the secondary server for update and delete commands.</p><h3 id=_ltsyncstrategyondemand_><em>&lt;SyncStrategy.ONDEMAND></em></h3><p>SyncStrategy.ONDEMAND will synchronize changes only when SyncManager.sync is invoked.</p><h3 id=_ltsyncstrategyscheduled_><em>&lt;SyncStrategy.SCHEDULED></em></h3><p>SyncStrategy.SCHEDULED will synchronize changes periodically once every time interval specified by AtClientPreference.syncIntervalMins has elapsed.</p><h2 id=scan-verb-methods>Scan Verb Methods</h2><p>The scan verb is used to retrieve all the available keys that are either public or have been specifically shared with some @sign that has been authenticated. This has been abstracted in the <em>getAtKeys</em> method of the AtClientSDK so as to be more familiar to application developers</p><h3 id=lt_getatkeys_>&lt;<em>getAtKeys</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;List&lt;AtKey&#187; getAtKeys({String? regex, String? sharedBy, String? sharedWith});</em></p><p>The <em>getAtKeys</em> method is used to execute the scan verb and retrieve a list of all the relevant keys from a secondary server. These can be filtered by applying a regular expression [<em>regex</em>], by specifying the “<em>sharedBy</em>” or “<em>sharedWith</em>” @signs.</p><h2 id=update-verb-methods>Update Verb Methods</h2><p>The update verb is used to write entries in the secondary server as key/value pairs. This has been abstracted in the <em>put</em> method of the AtClientSDK so as to be more familiar to application developers.</p><h3 id=lt_put_->&lt;<em>put</em>>** **</h3><p><em>Future&lt;bool> put(AtKey key, dynamic value, {bool isDedicated = false});</em></p><p>The <em>put</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to write data into a secondary server as a key/value pair. The @sign must be authenticated to run this method.</p><h3 id=lt_putmeta_>&lt;<em>putMeta</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;bool> putMeta(AtKey key);</em></p><p>The <em>putMeta</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to write metadata values for some key/value pair data on a secondary server without needing to update the value. This is done to increase efficiency. The @sign must be authenticated to run this method.</p><h2 id=lookup-verbs-methods>Lookup Verb(s) Methods</h2><p>The lookup verbs are used to read a value from a secondary server using a key. There are several variations of the protocol verb that the SDK uses to retrieve:</p><ul><li><p>lookup</p><p>The lookup verb is used to lookup a value on a secondary server for another @sign’s secondary server.</p></li><li><p>plookup</p><p>The plookup verb is used to lookup a public value from another @sign’s secondary server if the client is authenticated. The plookup verb can only be executed on a remote secondary server.</p></li><li><p>llookup</p><p>The llookup verb is used to lookup a value on the local secondary server of the current @sign.</p></li></ul><p>These have been abstracted in the <em>get</em> and <em>getMeta</em> methods in the AtClientSDK so as to be more familiar to application developers</p><h3 id=lt_get_>&lt;<em>get</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;AtValue> get(AtKey key, {bool isDedicated = false});</em></p><p>The <em>get</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to read the value of some key. It first attempts to read from the local persistence store, then from a remote cloud secondary server.</p><h3 id=lt_getmeta_>&lt;<em>getMeta</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;Metadata?> getMeta(AtKey key);</em></p><p>The <em>getMeta</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to read the metadata of some key that has been created automatically and contains useful information about the data, such as who it was created by, when it was created or updated, the current version, etc. It first attempts to read from the local persistence store, then from a remote cloud secondary server if not found.</p><h2 id=delete-verb-methods>Delete Verb Methods</h2><p>The delete verb is used for deleting key/value pair data on a secondary server. The AtClientSDK also uses the term <em>delete</em> for its method as well.</p><h3 id=lt_delete_>&lt;<em>delete</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;bool> delete(AtKey key, {bool isDedicated = false});</em></p><p>The <em>delete</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to delete the key and value from @sign’s local persistence and then syncs the deletion to the cloud secondary server according to the AtClient&rsquo;s sync preference (e.g. immediate).</p><h2 id=event-verbs-methods>Event Verb(s) Methods</h2><p>In order to efficiently ensure data gets communicated between secondary servers, there are two verbs that are used to manage the propagation of data events.</p><ul><li><p>monitor</p><p>The monitor verb is used to stream incoming notifications from the secondary server to @Client.</p></li><li><p>notify</p><p>The notify verb is used to notify another secondary server of an update or delete to some key/value pair.</p></li></ul><h3 id=lt_startmonitor_>&lt;<em>startMonitor</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;void> startMonitor(String privateKey, Function? notificationCallback, {String? regex});</em></p><p>The startMonitor method in the AtClientSDK is used to create a persistent connection to a secondary server to receive notifications. Whenever a notification is created on the server, the monitor calls the specified notification’s notificationCallback function. Optionally, a regular expression can be passed to filter the notifications.</p><h3 id=lt_notify_>&lt;<em>notify</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;bool> notify(AtKey key, String value, OperationEnum operation,</em></p><p>_ {MessageTypeEnum? messageType,_</p><p>_ PriorityEnum? priority,_</p><p>_ StrategyEnum? strategy,_</p><p>_ int? latestN,_</p><p>_ String? notifier,_</p><p>_ bool isDedicated = false});_</p><p>The <em>notify</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to propagate a change in the value for some key [AtKey] to the secondary server for the [sharedWith] @sign. Optionally, an operation can be specified and the data value and metadata can be sent along with the key as part of the notification. For rapidly changing data, the [isDedicated] parameter can be set to true to create a dedicated connection to the other secondary server.</p><h3 id=lt_notifyall_>&lt;<em>notifyAll</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;String> notifyAll(AtKey atKey, String value, OperationEnum operation);</em></p><p>The <em>notifyAll</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to propagate a change in the value for some key [AtKey] to a list of [sharedWith] @signs. Optionally, an operation can be specified and the data value and metadata can be sent along with the key as part of the notification.</p><h3 id=lt_notifylist_>&lt;<em>notifyList</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;String> notifyList({String? fromDate, String? toDate, String? regex});</em></p><p>The <em>notifyList</em> method in the AtClientSDK returns the list of received notifications of an @sign. Optionally, notifications can be filtered by from date, to date, and regular expression.</p><h3 id=lt_notifystatus_>&lt;<em>notifyStatus</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;String> notifyStatus(String notificationId);</em></p><p>The <em>notifyStatus</em> method in the AtClientSDK is used to check the status of a notification based on a notificationId.</p><h2 id=stream-verb-methods>Stream Verb Methods</h2><p>The @platform supports streaming connections in addition to asynchronous connections. The stream verb is used to create a direct connection between two AtClient instances that are joined together on the originator&rsquo;s secondary server that can be used to send an encrypted stream between two devices with @signs.</p><h3 id=lt_stream_>&lt;<em>stream</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;AtStreamResponse> stream(String sharedWith, String filePath, {String namespace});</em></p><p>The <em>stream</em> method in the AtClientSDK creates a persistent connection for encrypting and sending a file from a device [filePath] to a [sharedWith] @sign.</p><h2 id=file-sharing-methods>File Sharing Methods</h2><p>The @platform also includes a “store and forward” means of securely encrypting and sharing binary data (files) using a <a href=https://github.com/espebra/filebin2>filebin2</a> service as a temporary storage mechanism.</p><h3 id=lt_uploadfile_>&lt;<em>uploadFile</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;Map&lt;String, FileTransferObject&#187; uploadFile(List&lt;File> files, List&lt;String> sharedWithAtSigns);</em></p><p>The <em>uploadFile</em> method in the AtClientSDK can be used to upload a list of files to a filebin for temporary storage and then shares the file download url with [sharedWithAtSigns]. The method returns a map containing each sharedWithAtSign as the key(s) and [FileTransferObject] as the value(s) which contains the information required to download and decrypt the file.</p><h3 id=lt_downloadfile_>&lt;<em>downloadFile</em>></h3><p><em>Future&lt;List&lt;File&#187; downloadFile(String transferId, String sharedByAtSign, {String? downloadPath});</em></p><p>The <em>downloadFile</em> method in the AtClientSDK can be used to download a list of files for a given [transferId] that has been shared by [sharedByAtSign]. Optionally, you can include a [downloadPath] to download the files.</p><h2 id=config-verb-method>Config Verb Method</h2><p>The config verb is used to configure block list entries in the secondary server.
