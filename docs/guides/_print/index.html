This SDK provides the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>Data is stored in an encrypted keystore locally for your application</li><li>Data access is in-memory and super-fast</li><li>Offline access with the device is supported</li><li>Data is synchronized and backed up to a cloud @server automatically</li><li>Data is synchronized across all the person’s devices automatically</li><li>Privacy is hardcoded: The owner of the data controls all access to it</li></ul><p>Note: the cloud @server does not have access to the secret private key. This prevents bad actors from accessing or modifying private data not meant for them.</p><h5 id=creating-updating-and-deleting-data-with-your-application>Creating, updating and deleting data with your application</h5><p>Data operations that involve writing data to the @persistence keystore can only be done with the approval of the owner. Access to this data is cryptographically controlled. This is managed for your application by the @SDK and is remarkably easy. The types of access that can be set for each data record include:</p><ul><li>public: data that can be read by anyone without need for authentication</li><li>shared: data that the owner has explicitly granted the right to some entity to read it after proving they are who they claim to be</li><li>private: data that is only accessible to the owner (requires authentication)</li><li>hidden: publicly readable data that is not listed in a scan of the keystore.</li></ul><p>Naturally, the owner of an @persistence keystore has access to any and all data that is contained therein. After being authorized, your application can read the data that it needs from the keystore as well. Applications that prefer to rely on data within its own namespace can also store read data from the @persistence keystore with approval of the owner. As always, all data stored is owned and controlled by the owner of the @persistence keystore.</p><p>For more information on how your application can create, update, or delete data, see the <a href=https://pub.dev/packages/at_persistence_spec>@Persistence Keystore Guide</a> and the <a href=verbs>@Protocol Verbs</a>.</p><h4 id=accessing-data-shared-by-others>Accessing data shared by others</h4><p>Applications typically are a combination of an owner&rsquo;s data and data that has been shared with them by others. This is a new feature and is what we’re referring to when we talk about P2P (Peer-to-Peer) applications.</p><p>For example, messaging applications available today involve a combination of data (messages) from various people but have no way to ensure that each individual message belongs to its creator. With the @protocol, messages that I create and share with other people are owned by me and likewise, messages that others create and share with me are owned by them. The messaging application is thus responsible for interleaving and presenting these messages while simultaneously maintaining privacy controls for the owner of the data (i.e. I own my messages to you and you own your messages to me).</p><p>While this may seem confusing and difficult at first, the @Client SDK and the Flutter UI Component libraries make it very simple to implement. This results in surveillance-free, privacy-compliant applications that are simple, cost-effective, and efficient, with better performance than backend server-based applications of the past.</p><p>The @Client SDK provides the following capabilities that help to integrate data shared by others in your application:</p><ul><li>Public data shared by others can be looked up</li><li>The notification verb alerts your application when new data shared by others is available</li><li>The monitor verb creates a persistent connection for real-time interactions</li><li>Data can be scanned for and read directly from another persons @persistence keystore</li><li>Shared data is cached for fast, reliable access to shared data with all privacy related parameters managed for you by the @Client SDK</li></ul><p>For more information on how your application can create, update, or delete data, see the [@Persistence Keystore Guide](Persistence Keystore Guide) and the <a href=verbs>@Protocol Verbs</a>.</p><h4 id=accessing-and-reasoning-over-data-stored-by-other-applications>Accessing and reasoning over data stored by other applications</h4><p>One super interesting side effect of giving people control of their data and storing it all in one place is that any application that they authorize can reason over any data that they are allowed to access. Applications that are certified as @protocol compliant (@pps) can provide amazing new experiences because they have the ability to access and reason over all data stored in an @persistence keystore.</p><p>For example, a certified messaging app may contain a thread where a group of people are discussing which movie to go see on Wednesday night. If permitted, this information can also be presented as an event in their certified calendar application and similarly presented as a group in their certified contacts application.</p><h3 id=advanced-options>Advanced Options</h3><h4 id=create-a-separate-persistence-keystore-for-your-application-certification-not-required>Create a separate @persistence keystore for your application (certification not required)</h4><p>If you would like to store application data, you are free to use the @persistence keystore for your persistence if you want to. You may want to get your application certified anyways to advertise that it is privacy compliant and have it included in our list of certified apps.</p><h4 id=authentication-only-without-the-persistence-keystore-certification-not-required>Authentication only, without the @persistence keystore (certification not required)</h4><p>If your application does not require data persistence on behalf of the person using it; for example, if you just want to make sure that your application is licensed to the person using it, then you do not need to get it certified. You may want to get your application certified anyways to advertise that it is privacy compliant and have it included in our list of certified apps.</p><p>For more information about getting your application certified, see the <a href>Certification page</a>.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-19008db1f76436ac5b5bd7cfad587204>2 - The @platform persistence keystore guide</h1><div class=lead>How to use the @platform encrypted key/value store</div><h3 id=application-data-storage>Application data storage</h3><p>Data for your application is the combination of the device owner’s data with data that has been shared by others.
An @sign owner&rsquo;s data is&mldr;</p><ul><li>Stored in the the @sign owner&rsquo;s device’s (local) @persistence keystore</li><li>Accessed by others via their internet addressable, always-on, secure, cloud (remote) @server</li><li>Backed up in their secure cloud (remote) @server</li><li>Synchronized between their cloud (remote) @server and any other devices that belong to the owner</li><li>Secured by secret keys which are only stored on the @sign owner&rsquo;s device’s keychain</li></ul><p>Note: The @sign owner&rsquo;s cloud (remote) @server does not hold the owner’s secret key, which is required to make changes to the data. The local @server on the owner’s device must initialize any data changes.</p><p>Data that others have shared with an @sign owner is&mldr;</p><ul><li>Accessed directly from their secure cloud (remote) @server with full privacy controls so it is always up to date</li><li>Cached on the @sign owner&rsquo;s device’s local keystore if permitted</li><li>Removed from the @sign owner&rsquo;s device’s local keystore automatically according to the permissions set by the owner of the data</li><li>Updated upon change automatically using the notification verb</li></ul><h4 id=how-application-data-is-stored-and-retrieved>How application data is stored and retrieved</h4><p>As mentioned above, data is stored encrypted as a key/value pair. The @Client SDK supports a familiar set of methods to store and retrieve data from an @persistence keystore. You should always keep in mind that the @protocol includes strict privacy controls applied to all data in an @persistence keystore.</p><h4 id=application-access>Application Access</h4><h4 id=apps-can-reason-over-all-of-my-data-in-my-persistence-keystore>Apps can reason over all of my data in my @persistence keystore</h4><p>One super interesting side effect of giving people control of their data and storing it all in one place is that any application that they can choose to reason over any data that they are allowed to access in order to create altogether new user experiences.</p><p>For example, their certified messaging application may contain a thread where a group of people are discussing which movie to go see on Wednesday night. If permitted, this information can also be presented as an event in their certified calendar application as well as a group in their certified contacts application.</p><h4 id=access-within-an-application-namespace>Access within an application namespace</h4><p>Applications that only rely on data within its own namespace can also store data in the @persistence keystore if certified as @protocol compliant.

What does forking a repository mean? What is a pull request? How can you make a contribution?</p><h2 id=what-is-an-open-source-project>What is an open source project?</h2><p>For anyone who is new to not just software development but project management in general, an open source project is that of which any person has access to all of the details of the project and are free to utilize it, use it for research purposes, make modifications to it, and even distribute it elsewhere. GitHub of course, being one of the main wellsprings of open source projects! For the sake of this article, I will be using <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation>The @ Company’s atsign-foundation</a> repository to explain any examples.</p><h2 id=why-would-you-want-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project>Why would you want to contribute to an open source project?</h2><p>With the new, blossoming field of data science, being capable of finding your way around a GitHub project is a significantly useful skill in today’s world. You’ll find that many corporate entities will highlight your contributions to any GitHub project (as long as you have listed them within your résumé!). You’ll also find that there are many friendly developers who really appreciate the people who add modifications to the project, and especially if that modification comes with a flagged issue (there seems to be a special place in the heart of a developer for people who raise issues within their code)! There’s also this sense of great accomplishment when you can add something useful to a project, more importantly, for the projects that you use often.</p><h2 id=how-can-you-contribute-to-an-open-source-project>How can you contribute to an open source project?</h2><h3 id=choosing-a-project>Choosing a Project:</h3><p>The first step in contributing something to a project is knowing what project you will contribute to! I’d personally recommend thinking about a project or an idea you have familiarity with as this will greatly assist in understanding what the project’s purpose is.</p><h2 id=forking-a-repository>Forking a Repository:</h2><p>What is forking? In simplest terms, forking a project is simply making a copy of it to your own GitHub profile. GitHub allows anyone to fork a repository and this will allow you to do whatever you please with the entire repository without making any actual changes to the real project! Imagine it as taking a picture of a tree. You can make edits to your photo to make the tree look purple or to give it a face, but you won’t make any changes to the actual tree!</p><h3 id=how-to-fork-a-repository>How to Fork a Repository:</h3><p>First, navigate to the home page of the repository you wish to fork. Refer to the screenshot below:</p><p>Here, you can see that I am currently within the atsign-foundation’s ‘<a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos>at_demos</a>’ repository.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/fork-button.png alt=fork-button title="Fork button"></p><p>If you look at the top right corner of the repository’s page, you’ll notice the ‘Fork’ button and a number next to it. That number represents the number of times this specific repository has been forked. Once you select the Fork button, GitHub will prompt you which repository you wish to fork to. My go-to option is typically my own profile, where it will create an entire repository under your profile name so that you may make whatever modifications you wish. After you choose what location you wish to fork to, GitHub will do all of the hard work for you. After a few seconds or so (depending on your Internet connection speed), you’ll find that the entire repository that you forked, is now copied to wherever you told GitHub to fork it! Congratulations! You’ve forked a repository!</p><h3 id=make-modifications-to-the-repository>Make Modifications to the Repository:</h3><p>Now, you can do whatever your heart so desires with the project! Depending on what the project is, you may wish to clone the repository to your local machine using https/, or simply commit changes directly on your forked repository (totally your choice/preference!).</p><h3 id=creating-a-public-key-with-github>Creating a Public Key with GitHub</h3><p>We recommend git cloning the repository using the SSH key option. You can set up your own public keys on GitHub quite easily. If you see below, you will see the Clone options, &lsquo;HTTPS, SSH, and GitHub CLI&rsquo;. Select the &lsquo;SSH&rsquo; option and this will provide you a password-protected SSH key to git clone the repository.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/GitHub-Code-Options.png alt=GitHub-Code-Options title="download theme options"></p><p>In order to create a public key on your machine, open any UNIX terminal and type the command:</p><pre><code>ssh-keygen
</code></pre><p>From here, it will ask you to choose a lcoation to store the key. We suggest just clicking &lsquo;enter&rsquo; on whatever location is chosen for you. It will then ask for a passphrase, we STRONGLY recommend clicking &lsquo;enter&rsquo; again to not input a passphrase. After doing this, it will ask you to input the passphrase again and click &lsquo;enter&rsquo; without inputting anything. After having successully creating the key, enter the command:</p><pre><code>cat ~\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
</code></pre><p>This will print out your public key. Copy the entire thing, including the ssh in the beginning and whatever the final character is and navigate to your GitHub settings page. Within your settings, you will see a tab titled, &lsquo;SSH and GPG keys&rsquo;. Once you navigate to this page, you should see a green bottom near the top-left titled, &lsquo;New SSH key&rsquo;. Once you have clciked this and navigated to the new SSH Key page, you will have to input a name for the key as well as pasting the retrieved key copied from the above command. After you have done both of these things, you can finish with the &lsquo;Add SSH key&rsquo; button and you will now be able to git clone in your terminal with the SSH URL.</p><h3 id=create-a-pull-request>Create a Pull Request:</h3><p>After you are satisfied with the changes you have made to the project and are confident that this change will be beneficial to include, all you now have to do is create a pull request within the project’s real repository. GitHub has made it very simple to create a pull request for comparing forks. Refer to the screenshot below:</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/pull-request.png alt=pull-request title="Pull request option"></p><p>You may notice, in the top left corner of the repository, you will see the ‘Pull requests’ option. After selecting this, you will be taken to the Pull Requests page. This page will show you every pull request that has been created for the specific repository. If you see below, there has been one pull request for this repository thus far.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/page-pull-request.png alt=pull-request-page title="Pull request page"></p><p>If you are sure you are ready to create a new pull request, simply click the ‘New pull request’ button. This will then navigate you to the compare page. If you followed the above steps, you would want to ‘compare forks’, which will be a small hyperlink as circled below:</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/compare-changes.png alt=compare-changes title="Compare changes"></p><p>This will now change the base and head repositories that will be compared. Be sure to select the correct branch of the real project that you wish to make a pull request for. Select the same repository you forked and the correct branch as the ‘base’ repository and ‘base’ branch. You may need to contact the project leader or one of the main developers if you need assistance for which branch you need to make a pull request for. After selecting these, be very careful in selecting the repository that you forked. This will be where you had made the modifications. Select this repository as the ‘head’ repository and ‘compare’ branch.</p><p><img src=images/contributing-project/review-mods.png alt=review-mods title="Review modifications"></p><p>From here, you will see all of the modifications that will occur if your pull request is accepted. Once you double check all of these modifications and are confident in it, you may now select ‘Create pull request’. You may notice that mine says ‘View pull request’ but that is because I have already gone through this process and have successfully created one.</p><p>Side note:
Be sure that your contribution will be useful for those who utilize the project! If you do end up creating a pull request with your modifications, make sure that those modifications are properly documented in both the code and/or the comment section of the pull request itself.</p></div><div class=td-content style=page-break-before:always><h1 id=pg-f082fe2a70622eb94877c408ccde5a5f>4 -</h1><h1 id=working-with-hugo-static-webpage-generator>Working With Hugo (Static Webpage Generator)</h1><h2 id=overview>Overview:</h2><p>Hugo, an open-source static website generator, is a new way to create web pages easily with flexible thematic capabilities. How do you get started with it and how can you go from beginner to confident?</p><h2 id=what-is-hugo>What is Hugo?</h2><p>Hugo is a static site generator that can be seen as a competitor for WordPress and Bootstrap. The best part about Hugo that differentiates it from its competitors is that it is an open-source project, which means it’s free to use! Hugo also makes content management a headache-free, comprehensive process! Hugo can be incredible for this type of content management due to not even needing to write HTML if web development is not something you’re comfortable with! If you are the type who really enjoys getting your hands dirty, Hugo’s flexibility expands to allowing developers to completely modify everything about their own static web page. Now what’s a static web page? You can pretty much sum it up to be a hard-coded page of information that, of course, does not change dynamically. The best advantage that static web pages have over dynamic web pages is the extreme difference in speed. Because most dynamic websites are producing content for the individual visitor, it can take much longer to produce the content.</p><p>There’s a growing community behind Hugo with numerous Stack Overflow locations with any questions relevant to that of Hugo.
Getting Started with Hugo:</p><h2 id=windows>Windows:</h2><h3 id=installing-hugo-on-windows>Installing Hugo on Windows:</h3><p>There are a few ways in which you can get started with Hugo, however the easiest way I have found to getting started and jumping straight into things is by the following steps:</p><p>Create a directory in a location on your drive. For me, I have more storage capacity within my D: drive so I navigate to my D: drive within my File Explorer and simply right click and select ‘Folder’. This will create a new folder wherever you were within your drive. Next, rename this folder to ‘Hugo’. After this, navigate inside of your Hugo folder and create another folder within it, this time calling it ‘bin’.</p><p>You’re now ready to download Hugo on to your machine. As most projects which are open-source can be found on GitHub, so can Hugo’s releases. In any web browser, navigate to the <a href=https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases title="GoHugo Resources">GoHugoIo</a> repository. Here, you will find a great list of all of the releases catered for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Be sure to select a release that has your operating system in the title. For example, I am using a Windows 10 machine that runs a 64 bit processor. So I navigated to the zip file titled hugo_extended_0.83.1_Windows-64bit.zip. (Note: the release number may be different from the one listed above due to the time at which I have written this document. You may also noticed that I have chosen the extended Hugo version. Hugo extended has more capabilities, especially for thematic purposes. Hugo&rsquo;s extension comes with a few advantages such as; SASS/SCSS support, Minify javascript and css, resource catenation, source mapping, image processing and so much more. A more in depth view of it can be found <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/hugo-extended>here</a>.</p><p>Once you have found the matching release title for your machine, feel free to simply download the zip file. Where you download the zip file does not matter, however, where you extract it does. When your download is complete, select ‘Extract all’ and be sure that you extract the contents of what you downloaded into the ‘bin’ folder that exists within your Hugo folder. Once the extraction is complete, it should look something like this:</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_file_location.PNG alt=bin-folder title="bin folder"></p><p>For the release that I have downloaded and extracted, there are three files. Perhaps in a later release of Hugo, there may be more files included, but for now, as long as you have the application file titled ‘hugo’, you will be fine. If, for whatever odd reason, the ‘hugo’ file is titled something else, be sure to rename it to ‘hugo’ (note the lowercase ‘h’). There is also a license file and a readme. It is completely up to you if you read the readme and license files.</p><p>Determining if your Installation on Windows was successful:</p><p>Apologies in advance for MacOS and Linux users as I will be demonstrating the following steps using a Windows 10 machine. A later edit with both MacOS and Linux will be created to cater those who wish to learn from a separate operating system.
To make sure that your Hugo was successfully installed and extracted, open your command prompt [Some ways in which this can be done => (Win key + r, type ‘cmd’, hit ‘enter’), (Go to your Search bar and the bottom of your taskbar and type in ‘cmd’ or ‘command prompt’ and hit ‘enter’)] and navigate to the directory where you extracted Hugo. For the above picture, my hugo.exe file’s location was D:\Hugo\bin\hugo.exe, so all I have to type is ‘cd D:\Hugo\bin’ and I will be taken to where the hugo.exe exists. If you’re not sure where you had saved your Hugo folder, you can either use the File Explorer you have presently open and simply highlight the path that is in the bar above your currently open Hugo folder. I have circled it below for your convenience.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_file_location_circled.PNG alt=file-location title="file location"></p><p>To show what your command prompt should look like:
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_location.PNG alt=hugo-location title="cmd location"></p><p>Once you are here, feel free to try the command ‘hugo version’:
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo_ext_bin_version.PNG alt=hugo-version title="hugo version"></p><p>If your command prompt happily prints out the current version of Hugo you have on your machine, this means you have successfully installed and extracted Hugo onto your machine. However, you may notice that if you use the command ‘cd ..’ to move directories to the ‘Hugo’ folder rather than ‘bin’ and try the command ‘hugo version’ you will be hit with an error or Windows will tell you that hugo isn’t a recognized command.
<img src=images/getting-started/hugo-not-recognized.png alt=hugo-error title="hugo error"></p><p>If you are like me, and wish to be capable of using the hugo command anywhere on your machine, maybe because you would like to create a web page with its own folder and its own content, there is an easy way to fix this.</p><p>What you will have to do is navigate to your ‘Search’ bar and type in ‘env’ or ‘environment’. Windows will suggest the ‘Edit the System Environment Variables’. Open it and a System Properties dialog box should appear and look something like this:
<img src=images/getting-started/env-variables.png alt=env-variables title="system properties"></p><p>Double-click on the button labeled ‘Environment Variables’ and this will open the dialog box where you can edit the environment variables of your machine. You may be wondering what environment variables are and what they’re for. In simplest terms, just like how you noticed that your hugo command did not work outside of the bin folder, there are other applications that work the same way and will only work in the folder they exist in. Windows has the capability of allowing you to run the application from anywhere, which is exactly what we would like to do. You should see something in your ‘user variables’ called Path. Each Path that is listed, is more than likely an application, similar to your Hugo, that exists only in a folder but is used globally on your machine. Highlight ‘Path’ and click ‘Edit&mldr;’. This will open a new dialog box that will list the individual paths that already exist. Click ‘New’ and simply type (or paste) the location of your hugo.exe. If you may recall from my example, my hugo.exe was in the following location; D:\hugo_ext\bin.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-Path-Edit.png alt=hugo-path-edit title="environment variables"></p><p>Here’s what mine looks like after I have finished typing in where it exists (it is the one highlighted in blue). After you have done the same, you can now click ‘OK’ until all of the dialog boxes are closed. Now this is where the magic happens! After restarting your computer, try using the ‘hugo version’ command again outside of the ‘Hugo\bin’ folder and see if Windows recognizes it as a command! I simply started up my command prompt and immediately typed in ‘hugo version’ and it worked. If the command works, you are now ready to get started on a Hugo project.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/hugo-version-extended.PNG alt=Hugo-Version-Outside-Bin title="hugo version outside bin"></p><h2 id=mac>Mac:</h2><h3 id=installing-hugo-on-mac>Installing Hugo on Mac:</h3><p>The first step you will want to take is navigating to the website <a href=https://brew.sh title="Homebrew Installation">Homebrew</a>. This website is a package manager and allows you to install, download and manage packages. You can use <a href=https://brew.sh title="Homebrew Installation">Homebrew</a> to install Hugo easily on your computer. Once you are taken to the landing page, you should come across a terminal command that looks like:</p><pre><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot;
</code></pre><p>// NOTE:
// This command may be updated depending on any new releases,
// so be sure to check the website before copying the line of code above!</p><p>Simply paste the line of code into your terminal. Once you click enter and input your password for administrative access, Homebrew will begin installing itself onto your machine. This can take a few minutes. Once Homebrew is finished, you can then type the command:</p><pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><p>Homebrew may update itself automatically before installing hugo.</p><h3 id=determining-if-your-installation-on-windows-was-successful>Determining if your Installation on Windows was successful:</h3><p>You can validate your install by the command:</p><pre><code>which hugo
</code></pre><p>You can also use the command:</p><pre><code>hugo version
</code></pre><p>If you run into an error, proceed through the Windows steps and follow the instructions up until the GitHub section where you manually install the package from the repository for your own machine.</p><h2 id=creating-a-hugo-project>Creating a Hugo project:</h2><p>Depending on your operating system, open your command prompt/terminal. You can also launch an IDE of your preference and have the terminal open within it. To create a new hugo project, be sure that you are within a directory that you would want to have your Hugo project created in. For this article, I will create a new folder within my D: drive (Windows) and then use the command:</p><pre><code>hugo new site your_name_here
</code></pre><p>Refer to the steps within my command prompt below: I first check that my hugo command works, change directory into my D: drive, create a new folder called, ‘my_hugo_site’, navigate into that folder, and then create a new Hugo site called, ‘my_hugo_project’.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-New-Site.png alt=Hugo-New-Site title="hugo version outside bin"></p><p>If you receive the ‘Congratulations!’ message, this means that you have successfully created a new Hugo site. If you expand the project folder to see its contents, you will see that a few folders have been created. (Be sure that you navigate within your newly created project first!)</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Hugo-Project-Folders.png alt=Hugo-Project-Folders title="hugo version outside bin"></p><p>The number of folders created here may seem a bit overwhelming, but have no fear! We will go over what each folder is for.</p><h3 id=archetypes>Archetypes:</h3><p>The first folder is the ‘archetypes’ folder. This folder is typically used by those more confident with Hugo. An archetype, in its simplest form, is simply a constant that occurs throughout all of the content of your website, something that will not change. With Hugo, you can manually create data about your site (for you Computer Scientists, that’s metadata!). What this means is that you can assign values to things that will not be changing. This could mean, who initially created the website, what date it was created, what information populates the site itself, and etc.</p><h3 id=content>Content:</h3><p>A very self explanatory folder, this is where the main content of your site will exist.</p><h3 id=data>Data:</h3><p>You can almost view this as your website’s own database which can house .json files and allows you to utilize information that exists within external pieces.</p><h3 id=layouts>Layouts:</h3><p>Just like a word document, if you wish to add information within the same location of every page that exists on your website, such as a header or a footer, this is where you would add that.</p><h3 id=static>Static:</h3><p>This is, of course, where your static elements will exist. These elements may include your javascript or css files.</p><h3 id=configtoml>config.toml:</h3><p>This file contains the settings of your website, such as its URL, what language it contains, and the title of the website.</p><h3 id=themes>Themes:</h3><p>If graphic design isn’t one of your strengths, Hugo being an open-source project means that there are countless persons releasing their own themes and layouts for you to use! You can browse these themes <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io title="Hugo Themes">here</a>. Installing a theme is just as simple as downloading a folder to your machine, because that is exactly what you are doing! You may notice that every theme which peaks your interest will also exist on GitHub. You can use whatever method you prefer to retrieve the code. In this document, I will demonstrate a couple ways to do this. Once you find a theme that suits your needs or ‘aesthetic’, simply click on the theme. You may see two or three buttons, ‘Download’, ‘Demo’, ‘Homepage’. If you are confident that this is the theme you want, click ‘Download’ and it will take you to the GitHub repository where the theme exists. Click on the green ‘Code’ button and this will give you a few options on how to retrieve the code.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/GitHub-Code-Options.png alt=Git-Clone-Theme title="download theme options"></p><p>For this example, I have found a theme that interests me titled ‘Dream’. For users who have Git, you can copy the https link and navigate into the ‘themes’ folder of your project to git clone it. Refer to the screenshot below (I am using Git Bash):</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Git-Clone-Theme.png alt=Git-Clone-Theme title="git bash theme clone"></p><p>When you clone the repository, it will automatically create a folder for you. However, if you are not sure how to use Git, you can simply download the Zip file onto your machine. Before installing this zip folder, be sure to create a folder within your ‘themes’ folder with the appropriate title of the theme you are downloading. After downloading the zip folder, you should extract the contents into the folder that you just created inside of your ‘themes’ folder. You can see in the screenshot below, that the folder ‘hugo-theme-dream’ exists within the ‘themes’ folder.</p><p><img src=images/getting-started/Theme-File-Location.png alt=Theme-File-Location title="themes folder"></p><p>After successfully implementing the above steps, navigate into your config.toml file and add the line of code below everything else that exists in the file:</p><pre><code>theme = “folder_name_here”
</code></pre><p>So, in my case, I would type the following:</p><pre><code>theme = “hugo-theme-dream”
</code></pre><p>After adding this line, save the document and to make sure that you have properly called this theme into your site use the following command in your command prompt/terminal to start up your Hugo local server:</p><pre><code>hugo server -D
</code></pre><p>The -D will launch all of the draft pages that exist within your project folder.</p><p>After this, you can now open any web browser and type in the URL:</p><p><a href=http://localhost:1313>localhost:1313</a></p><p>You should now see your website and the theme you installed! From here, if you wish to contrbute, I recommend reading through our &lsquo;Contributing to an Open-Source Project&rsquo; document!</p><h3 id=steps-for-setting-up-our-hugo-dev-site-on-your-machine>Steps for Setting up our hugo dev site on your machine</h3><ol><li><p>Since I have already created a fork of the atsign.dev repo, all I simply have to do is fetch the upstream for any recent changes made.</p></li><li><p>I then proceed to git pull the updated forked repo (or if you haven&rsquo;t already simply git clone it).</p></li><li><p>You now need to edit the config.toml file so that your theme = &ldquo;at_docsy&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Get the https:// link from the at_docsy repo on our <a href=https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_docsy.git>GitHub</a></p></li><li><p>If you are using Git Bash all you have to do is navigate within the atsign.dev folder that contains the folders; content, archetypes, assets, etc. and use the command:</p></li></ol><pre><code>git submodule add &quot;https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_docsy.git&quot; themes/at_docsy
