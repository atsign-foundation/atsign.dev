The [@platform](/docs/resources/glossary/#@platform) was open-sourced in November of 2020 and we’ve been working hard to make your onboarding experience as smooth as possible ever since.

We’re excited to help you get your very own @platform environment up and running!

## Prerequisites

You will need Flutter/Dart installed on your machine. If you haven’t already, please follow the “Get started” steps on [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev) before you proceed. Flutter works best with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), but you can also use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your IDE.

Why did we choose Flutter? Here are some of our favorite reasons:

• Beautiful User Interface that allows you to control every pixel in your app, bring your brand to life, and provide flawless People experiences.

• Apps directly compile to native ARM code for screaming fast and efficient project builds housing buttery-smooth animations that allow GPU acceleration.

• Hot Reload. Make an edit to your code and Flutter will update your source code files and automatically rebuild the widget tree, allowing you to see your edits almost immediately. No more rebuilding your application time and time again.

• It's free and open-source, just like the rest of the @protocol, and there are countless numbers of packages on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) that any developer is free to use. The Flutter community is growing fast and would love to welcome you!

Android Studio is an incredible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) you can use to create projects for Android devices, and to ease this process,it allows you set up an Android Virtual Device (or AVD). If you’re looking for an easy IDE to get started on, this is the one we recommend. Most of our code, documentation, and tutorials are created with Android Studio, so you’ll feel right at home!

IntelliJ is another commonly used IDE. It has a similar feel to Android Studio and is comparable to the other two IDE's recommended here.

Visual Studio Code, when compared to IntelliJ and Android Studio, is the most customizable with a seemingly endless number of programming languages to utilize. Developers commonly call this IDE ‘VS Code’ (who has time to say entire words anyway?). If you have watched our tutorials on atsign.dev, you’ll notice that VS Code is the other IDE of choice with our devs!

If you wish to develop with testable, dummy @signs, you will also need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on your machine.

Your machine's operating system must be completely up to date.

## Where should I go next?

There are three ways to get going with your journey on the @platform. You may choose any of the three options listed below.
