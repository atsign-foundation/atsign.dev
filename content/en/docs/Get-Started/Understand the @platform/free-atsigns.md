## What are Namespaces?

Namespace is a common term that may occur when reading about the @platform.

Feel free to read all about namespaces [here](https://atsigncompany.medium.com/the-hidden-beauty-of-protocol-namespaces-6f5fab7f7a09).

<!-- ## Getting @signs and keys.

Your first step is to get a couple of @signs, it is best to get at least two, so you can experiment with sharing end-to-end
encrypted data across the @platform.

### There are two methods to get @signs.

#### The first

Go to [atsign.com](https://atsign.com) and clicking [Get an @sign](https://atsign.com/get-an-sign/). If you go
this route then you have more influence on your free @sign or pay for one of your choosing. Once you have your @signs,
do not forget to activate them.

![activate @sign](/docs/Get-Started/get-an-atsign/images/activate-ui.png)

Activating creates a microservice (we call the secondary server) and once
that is spun up on Atsign infrastructure you will see a QR-Code to scan with an @ enabled application.

![activated @sign](/docs/Get-Started/get-an-atsign/images/activated.png)

The pairing consists of your device creating cryptographic
keys and sharing the public keys to the secondary server, you will be asked to store your private keys.
Storing your keys is vitally important as only you have the keys.

#### The second

The experience of getting a @sign via the website is great for developers as you have advanced options available, to reset
@signs and to point your @sign to your own infrastructure. For getting people onboarded quickly, a better experience would
be to get a free @sign within the app itself, this is option 2.

![generate @sign](/docs/Get-Started/get-an-atsign/images/generate-free-@sign.png)

The [onboarding widget](https://pub.dev/packages/at_onboarding_flutter) together with an API key provides a button
marked "Generate Free @sign".

![generate @sign-pair](/docs/Get-Started/get-an-atsign/images/generate-free-@sign-pair.png)

When selected a number of free @signs given to chose from, once selected it is quickly activated,
then once again you will be asked to store the cryptographic keys for the @sign.

### Once you have your @signs and keys

You are ready to start using the @platform! We have a number [demo apps](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_demos) that are constantly being updated, feel free to
fork or clone and try them.
There is also another nice app in development by [xavierchanth](https://github.com/XavierChanth/chit_chat) which is a
chat app using the @platform. It is a nice example to follow as it uses the [contacts](https://pub.dev/packages/at_contact)
combined with the [at_chat_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/at_chat_flutter) widgets to create a simple chat app between
@signs.

![ChitCh@t](/docs/Get-Started/get-an-atsign/images/ChitCh@t-low.png)

Each @ enabled application will ask you once for your @sign and then your keys, so it can synchronize with your secondary server.
This means you might like to store your keys on a personal network drive or service (e.g. gdrive/idrive/onedrive) so
you can connect other @ enabled apps to your @sign easily. Remember not to share and protect your keys.

### Other widgets and the @platform/@protocol source code

We have an ever-growing number of widgets on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/atsign.org/packages)
The @plaform and the @protocol are open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/atsign-foundation). If you see something missing,
or not working let us know or better still contribute with a PR!

## Where should I go next?

First, if you haven't setup Flutter, do that [here](/docs/get-started/setup-your-env/).

Otherwise, continue to building your first app [here](/docs/get-started/create-a-project/). -->
