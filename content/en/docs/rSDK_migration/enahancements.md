## Network availability callback service.

- Apps can subscribe to network availability callback service to know when the network goes off and on. Some of the services offered by SDK is subscribing to this service internally.

    ```dart
    final ConnectivityListener connectivityListener = ConnectivityListener();
    connectivityListener.subscribe().listen((isConnected) {
    if(isConnected) {
    print('connected');
    } else {
    print('disconnected');
    }
    });

    // call this when app is closed or you no longer need the subscription
    connectivityListener.unSubscribe() 
    ```

## Response objects.

- Notification Response Object.

    ```dart
    class AtNotification {
    late String id;
    late String key;
    late String from;
    late String to;
    late int epochMillis;
    String? value;
    String? operation;
    }
    ```

    ```dart
    class SyncResult {
    SyncStatus syncStatus = SyncStatus.not_started;
