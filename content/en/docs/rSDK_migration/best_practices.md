- Do not cache instances of `AtClient` or any other services in the app code. Always make use of “AtClientManager” to get the right instance.


- Subscribe to only specific notifications.

    - Secondary server sends certain system level notifications to the SDK. All of these system notifications will not be of interest to the apps.


- Use response parsers where the app has to deal with raw responses from the server.

    - Secondary server sends responses in various forms for various verbs. Ideally app developers should not have to know the specific response format. Response parsers are made available in SDK to parse these responses and give back simple beans that the app can operate on.


- Build feedback loops into the apps when an operation fails

    - For example, if @X wants to notify @Y, the operation might fail for many reasons. SDK would let the caller know the reason for failure. It is better to act on the failure in the app code. It could be as simple as logging it.


- Do not write any services to optimize the SDK code. There is a good chance that we are already working on it. Make sure that you raise an enhancement request for any such requirement. 


- Use sync with regex with caution. It is advised to use without regex unless you are really sure about it.
